# this mini program write 2 values into registers (one that will be affected by the signed insruction and one that will not), store them in memory and then write them back into different registers

# Tracing:
# $16 = 0x0001 == 1 
# $17 = 0x00a0 == 160
# $18 = 0x8   ==8
# memory 0x8=1    
# memory 0xc=160 == -96 == a0
# $8 = 0x00000001 = 1
# $9 = 0xffffffa0 = -96 (yup -96)

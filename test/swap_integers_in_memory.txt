// The following assembly code swaps the values in two consecutive memory
// locations which are 40 and 44, the address 40 is stored in $s0

// First, initiating two consecuive words in memory

addi $s0, $0, 40
addi $t0, $0, 7
sw $t0, 0($s0)
addi $t0, $0, 18
sw $t0, 4($s0)

// The swapping part

lw $t1, 0($s0)
lw $t2, 4($s0)
sw $t1, 4($s0)
sw $t2, 0($s0)

Tracing:

$s0 = 40 
$t0 = 7
Mem[40] = 7
$t0 = 18
Mem[44] = 18

$t1 = 7
$t2 = 18
Mem[44] = 7
mem[40] = 18
